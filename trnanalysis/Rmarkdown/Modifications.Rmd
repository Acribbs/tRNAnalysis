tRNAnalysis performs variant calling that provides information that makes it possible to identify  chemical tRNA modifications.


## vcf tables {.tabset .tabset-fade}

We are in the process of deciding how best to display this data in graph form. In the meantime, the data plotted here can be accessed wihtin the variant_calling.dir/.

full_files <- list.files(path="../variant_calling.dir/",pattern = ".var.flt.vcf")

for (i in full_files){
  vcf <- tryCatch(read.table(paste0("../variant_calling.dir/",i), sep = "\t", header = FALSE, blank.lines.skip=TRUE), error=function(e) NULL)

  }
  
  cat("### ",i,"\n")

  cat('\n\n')
